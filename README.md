Project Title: Programming for Psychologist, Meta-analysis of FMRI data on bipolar disorder

Name: Elisa Bierman

Date of Completion: 03-12-2025

Link to data: https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/bipolar%20disorder/

Description of the project: This project visualizes anatomical and functional data from meta-analysis of consistent activity in fMRI data of 130 studies with a high frequency of mentioning the term bipolar disorder (source: Neurosynth website). The first figure shows three dissection slices of the brain with a color map of different Z-scores for the functional association between brain regions and bipolar disorder. The second figure is a histogram to show the distribution of Z-scores.
